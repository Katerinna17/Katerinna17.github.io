<p>Who am I? I am a person who loves to observe, I love observing the reactions people have when a person is “different”. I love to dress different because it’s just so sad and funny to see how people judge me because of the way I act and dress. I am a person who only loves showing my sweet lovable and silly self to people I think aren’t like those other people. Not to be rude those people are probably lost in what we call “social norms” that we have established in this generation and past generations. But I am a person who feels pity for those people, and respect for the people who don't see differences but acknowledges them.

<p>Oh klahoma by Jack Staurber is my favorite song because of the lyrics "I see those eyes and I hear those cries.
  I cant be the only one who sees them".
  this reminds me of myself because when my friends are sad I feel like im the only one who notices it.
Another of my favorite songs is also by jack stabuer and it's called buttercup! butter cup is such a good song and
its also really fun to listen to since jack stauber makes such weird noises.</p>
